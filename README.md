# Employee Tracker

## Description 

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. This assignment uses node, inquirer, and MySQL to build a solution for managing a company's employees.

## User Story
